## Name
isGame:True

## Description
After a long day at work, or just needing to get your mind off things, what could be better than playing a video game? We have crafted a web game called “isGame: True” with the help of phaser.io that tests your reaction time and speed. It involves different scenes as you progress, a health bar that decreases every time you collide with the enemy, and a sword to help you defend yourself. The goal is to avoid all of the enemies and get as many stars as you can in the meantime. Also with the help of sequelize, you can sign up and save your data for the next time you need a lil break!

## Technologies Used
